# Kickstart
Implementation of a Kickstarter-like ethereum smart contract designed by Stephen Grider and JS application using Node, React, Next.js and Semantic-UI
Notes: 
1. Node and Next are not duplicated in this repo
2. Actual smart contract implementation on Rinkeby at 0x75F5e93CA3961247Cc18e20A1de46463F58442a2
3. Deploy.js have 12 word mnemonic wallet key and Infura key removed. Get your own.
This was really fun to do because I got to play with a bunch of technologies: JavaScript, ES6, HTML, CSS, Node.js, React.js, Redux.js, Next.js, Semantic-UI, Ethereum, Web3, Metamask, Ganache, Mocha, JSON, Webpack Bable, and a handful of common JavaScript libraries in a holistic project from mockups through testing.
Although Stephen Griders' work was pretty solid on this and explainations adequate, I still had to work through a lot of bugs and version updates. As a matter of practice I wanted to do the version updates for security and to practice porting in new features and bug fixes. Also, I worked on a Windows box and found a few hassles where packages didn't handle things right. Serves me right for using Win, but also a reminder of the challenges porting between OSs.
